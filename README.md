> _CBLE is pronounced as "cable"_

Cloud-Based Lab Emulator (CBLE) is a self-service lab platform designed to be used in academic institutions, cyber ranges, and pretty much anywhere automated infrastructure deployment is needed. Blueprints can be created and released on CBLE and users can then request their own copies of this blueprinted infrastructure.
